# CVE Operator

## Overview

The CVE Operator is a Kubernetes operator designed to monitor GitHub repositories for new releases and process CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data. It consists of two main Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): GitHubReleasesMonitor and GitHubRelease.

This Repo introduces the CVE Operator, a Kubernetes-native solution for monitoring and processing GitHub releases containing CVE data.

Development:
- Implement GitHubReleasesMonitor CRD and controller
- Implement GitHubRelease CRD and controller
- Add GitHub API integration for checking new releases
- Create processor for downloading and handling delta zip files
- Implement Job creation and management for CVE data processing
- Create Dockerfiles for both operator and processor
- Update README with comprehensive project documentation

Technical details:
- Use client-go for Kubernetes API interactions
- Implement reconciliation loops for both controllers
- Use go-github library for GitHub API interactions
- Implement custom logic for delta zip file processing

## Features

- Monitor GitHub repositories for new releases
- Automatically create GitHubRelease resources for new releases
- Process delta zip files containing CVE data
- Implement retry logic for failed jobs
- Use finalizers to ensure proper resource cleanup

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.17+
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.19+)
- kubectl
- kustomize
- Access to a container registry

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

### GitHubReleasesMonitor

This CRD is responsible for monitoring a GitHub repository for new releases.

Fields:
- `spec.url`: The URL of the GitHub repository to monitor
- `spec.monitorFrom`: Can be "now" or a specific date in RFC3339 format

Status:
- `status.releases`: List of processed releases
- `status.lastChecked`: Timestamp of the last check
- `status.monitorFromTime`: Timestamp from which monitoring started

### GitHubRelease

This CRD represents a single GitHub release that needs to be processed.

Fields:
- `spec.url`: The URL of the specific release
- `spec.tagName`: The tag name of the release

Status:
- `status.processed`: Boolean indicating if the release has been processed
- `status.processedAt`: Timestamp of when the release was processed
- `status.jobStatus`: Status of the processing job
- `status.retryCount`: Number of retry attempts

## Controllers

### GitHubReleasesMonitorReconciler

This controller watches GitHubReleasesMonitor resources and performs the following actions:
1. Checks for new releases using the GitHub API
2. Creates GitHubRelease resources for new releases
3. Updates the status of the GitHubReleasesMonitor resource
4. Implements finalizer logic for proper cleanup
5. Recreates deleted GitHubRelease resources if necessary

Key methods:
- `Reconcile`: Main reconciliation loop
- `checkNewReleases`: Interacts with GitHub API to check for new releases
- `recreateDeletedReleases`: Recreates GitHubRelease resources if they've been deleted

### GitHubReleaseReconciler

This controller watches GitHubRelease resources and performs the following actions:
1. Creates a Kubernetes Job to process the release
2. Monitors the Job status and updates the GitHubRelease status accordingly
3. Implements retry logic for failed jobs
4. Uses finalizers for proper resource cleanup

Key methods:
- `Reconcile`: Main reconciliation loop
- `createOrGetJob`: Creates or retrieves the processing Job
- `deleteExternalResources`: Cleans up associated resources when a GitHubRelease is deleted

## Processor

The processor is a separate Go application that runs inside the Kubernetes Job. It's responsible for:
1. Downloading the delta zip file from the GitHub release
2. Processing the CVE data (implementation details depend on your specific requirements)

The processor code is located in `cmd/processor/main.go` and is built into a Docker image using `Dockerfile.processor`.

## Building and Deploying

### Building the Operator

1. Build the operator image:
   ```
   docker build -t your-registry/cve-operator:latest .
   docker push your-registry/cve-operator:latest
   ```

2. Build the processor image:
   ```
   docker build -f Dockerfile.processor -t your-registry/cve-processor:latest .
   docker push your-registry/cve-processor:latest
   ```

Replace `your-registry` with your actual container registry.

### Deploying to Kubernetes

1. Install the CRDs:
   ```
   make install
   ```

2. Deploy the operator:
   ```
   make deploy IMG=your-registry/cve-operator:latest
   ```

3. Create a GitHubReleasesMonitor resource:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: cve.my.domain/v1
   kind: GitHubReleasesMonitor
   metadata:
     name: example-monitor
   spec:
     url: https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/releases
     monitorFrom: now
   ```

   Apply this with:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f config/samples/cve_v1_githubreleasesmonitor.yaml
   ```

## Local Development

1. Run the operator locally:
   ```
   make run
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, create CRD instances:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f config/samples/
   ```

3. Watch the operator logs and kubectl get commands to see the resources being created and processed.

## Testing

Run the tests with:
```
make test
```

## Troubleshooting

- Check the operator logs:
  ```
  kubectl logs -n cve-system deployment/cve-operator-controller-manager -c manager
  ```

- Check the status of GitHubReleasesMonitor and GitHubRelease resources:
  ```
  kubectl get githubreleasesmonitors
  kubectl get githubreleases
  ```

- Check the status of the processing Jobs:
  ```
  kubectl get jobs
  ```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
